This article emphasized the importance of communication and planning when it comes to wireframes. It is key to completely understand the problem you are trying to solve before you plan the solution. This includes understanding the context of the work, aka where it will live, who the audience will be, etc. It is also important to discuss with the people who the work is for to better understand these things as well as how much detail they would like to be put in. Some wireframes can be completely barebone and some should have more detail. Overall, discussion and research throughout the whole project allows for greater success.
